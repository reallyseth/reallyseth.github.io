I am really Seth, a husband and father, Chief Technology Officer at [Red Starfish](http://starfishci.com), iOS developer, and pastor at [Jubilee Church](http://jubileestl.org). From time to time I do freelance work on the side, so if you would like me to help you with a project, send me an email at &#105;&#110;&#102;&#111;&#064;&#114;&#101;&#097;&#108;&#108;&#121;&#115;&#101;&#116;&#104;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;.
