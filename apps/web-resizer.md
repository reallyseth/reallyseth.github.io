## A Resizable Web Browser for the iPad
The idea came to me when I began designing and building responsive web sites early in 2012. I often used my iPad as my main computing device, but had no way to easily test responsive designs since Safari only runs full screen. Necessity is the mother of invention.

## Features
- Supports widths from 320px to 1024px
- Dynamically resize the window by moving a slider
- Jump to a specific size by typing it in ## Web Resizer will be in the App Store once it is approved.
- AirPlay support. Display your responsive sites up on a big screen. Great for demoing your site.
- Login to secure sites
- Simple design
- A little bit of awesome

Hope you enjoy.
